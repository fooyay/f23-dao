# Basic DAO

This ain't a great approach but covers some of the basics of a DAO pattern.

1. We'll have a contract governed by a DAO.
2. Every transaction that the DAO wants to send has to be voted on.
3. We will use ERC20 tokens for voting.

Again, this is a suboptimal approach and just for learning purposes.
